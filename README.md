# **Financial Data Analysis & Explanation using LLMs**  

## **📌 Problem Statement**  
Financial statements are crucial for understanding a company's performance and health, yet they are often filled with complex jargon, intricate calculations, and details that can be overwhelming for the average reader.  

As financial literacy becomes increasingly important, there is a growing need for innovative solutions that can bridge the knowledge gap and empower individuals to make informed financial decisions.  

The task is to develop an application or platform that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI** to simplify and explain complex financial statements in a way that is **accessible to amateurs**.  

The application should provide:  
✔ **Clear, concise explanations**  
✔ **Visual summaries**  
✔ **Insights in the form of stories** derived from financial documents
